		<h3>Q & A</h3>

                <div><h4>Scoped Containers</h4></div>
                <div>These hierarchies of container can be set up with parents and children refering to each other, or
                    children referring to parents only, or parents referring to children only. This changes the way that
                    things work considerably. If a child has its parent registered, then it can lean on it for component
                    resolution (but not without). If a parent has its child registered as a child, then it can manage it
                    (start, stop, dispose cascade into children).</div>
                <div>Web frameworks that leverage scoped container typically construct a tree of containers. For example
                    an application level container maintains components that can be shared across the application. The
                    application container will have child containers to maintain session level components. These session
                    level containers can resolve dependencies through their parent containers, but the application container
                    will have no visibility into its children. Additionally these child container do not have visibility
                    into their sibling containers. With this design, containers can easily be garbage collected at the end
                    of their scope.</div>
